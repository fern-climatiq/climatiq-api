      docs: In addition to direct calculation of emissions per passenger-kilometer, passenger-mile, tonne-kilometer or ton-mile, Climatiq makes endpoints available for calculating emissions based on departure and arrival airports. The API will automatically select an emission factor, currently based on choosing the highest available CO2e value; a specific ID can be selected to override this.
