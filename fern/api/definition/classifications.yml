        Many sources link emission factors to specific industry classification schemes, 
        and Climatiq makes it possible to select an emission factor based on these industry classification codes. 
        Please see below the list of mappings we currently support, with the datasets that are mapped directly to them (note that the API will also map factors indirectly via the UN correspondence tables):
        INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION CODE	PRIMARY DATASET
          ISIC Rev. 4	| GHG Protocol (via ISIC 3.1)
          NACE Rev. 2	| EXIOBASE3

      endpoints:
        estimate:
          docs: | 
            This endpoint lets you specify an industry classification code (ISIC or NACE) 
            and have Climatiq automatically select the appropriate emission factor. 
            One industry code might be linked to more than one emission factor. 
            If that happens, Climatiq will automatically select the most conservative emission factor. 
            If you would like to specify exactly what emission factor to use, you can specify other attributes to filter on, such as year, source or region.
