    CustomActivitiesService:
      docs: Instead of using code to specify emission factors you want to use for your calculations, you can map your own activity identifiers to Climatiq IDs in the Climatiq dashboard, allowing the Climatiq API to recognize whatever values you use to categorize your activities. In the dashboard simply link a custom activity label to an emission factor id, and this can then be used in the custom activities endpoints.

        estimate:
          docs: | 
            Calculate total estimated emissions produced for a particular activity in kgCO2e using a custom activity that you have defined under the Activity Mapping tab inside your Climatiq Dashboard.
            A custom activity label provides the same flexibility as the ID it maps to. This can happen when multiple emission factors share an emission factor id or because you have mapped the same custom activity to different emission factor ids.
            You can provide parameters to select emission factors by filtering using year, region, data source and more as described in our selector section. If there are multiple emission factors Climatiq will automatically pick the most conservative one.
