            Allows you to determine what emission factors are available to be used in your estimates.
            You can search for free-text queries with the query parameter, or filter by parameters such as category, source, region, year calculation_method, lca_activity or id.
            If you are using the query parameter, the results will be returned in order of how well they match your free-text query.
            This endpoint is paginated, and will return current_page and last_page so you can determine which page you are on. You switch pages by using the page query parameter.
